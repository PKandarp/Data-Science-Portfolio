# Data Science Portfolio

This is a repository of the projects I have worked on or are in progress. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of the projects is to to use data science/statistical modelling techniques to find something interesting. A typical project consist of finding and cleaning data, analysis, visualization and conclusion. Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.

# Projects

## Machine Learning Algorithms
[Linear Regression](https://github.com/PKandarp/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Linear%20Regression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
- A linear regression model is applied to an e-commerce dataset to decide whether to focus the efforts of the company on its mobile app or website development based on customer behavior.

[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/PKandarp/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
- A logistic regression model is applied to an advertising dataset to predict whether or not the user will click on an advertisement based off of the features of that user.

[K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/PKandarp/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb)
- A KNN classification model is applied to a classified data set to directly predict a class for a new data point based off of the features. The dataset has hidden feature column names but the target class and data are provided.
